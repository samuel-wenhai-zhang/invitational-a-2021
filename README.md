# Invitational A 2021

To help with testing your code do the following:

* The `WorkHere` folder has the student dat files (what you would see at competition).  Write your initial solutions in this folder, using the `.dat` files to test.

* When you think your solution is correct, copy your .java file into the top level folder, which has the judges' dat files and will be used for the "autograding".  Check that your resulting output matches the .out file in `JudgeOut`` for the problem.  Debug as necessary.

If you don't put your `.java` file in top level, the autograder **will not see it**.

Note: The rebecca.dat file is not actually the judges' file.  The judges' file for this problem is about 45 megabytes.  If you want to test your program we will have to run it separately. :)
